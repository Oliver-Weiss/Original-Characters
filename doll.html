            <p><i>Doll is defective. Under its bang lays an amber-colored, cracked eye that portrays its state. If Doll ever got fixed, the act would wipe its personality and return it to its default state. Having been abandoned by its creator and last owner with no next owner, Doll has no purpose or mission. It spends its days with its significant other, traveling and relaxing. Should it be given the opportunity to have a new owner, it would take it.</i></p>

            <p><i>Your muse is a very old immortal. One day, they find a peculiar little creature and take it into their home.

And with this in mind, they finally do something they've been wanting to for a while: starting a new life.</i></p>
