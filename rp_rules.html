    <h1 class="animate__animated animate__swing">- RP RULES -</h1>
    <ol class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">
        <li>Do not spam me. If I don't reply, I'm busy. Spamming will result in an auto-block. Feel free to poke me if I haven't replied within two weeks.</li>
        <li>For canon x OC, I only do double-up RP (I play canon for your OC, and you play canon for my OC).</li>
        <li>No one-liners, small replies (unless we're in a non-exciting part of the roleplay where there's just filler conversation going on), or text talk in RP (2, u, tn, etc...)</li>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years of age for roleplay. Minors make me uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>Be at least semi-literate. Readable text and at least 3-5 sentences on average.</li>
        <li>RP in the third person! First/second person makes me uncomfortable and has a chance of triggering my dissociation.</li>
        <li>Talk to me OOC! I like making friends and we have less of a chance of ghosting each other that way.</li>
        <li>I prefer literate to advanced literate roleplay. Really getting into the psychology, how chaacters are feeling/thinking, etc. 💕</li>
        <li>Don't hold back your muse! If you're unsure, ask me if I'm uncomfortable with something. If I do something in RP to make you uncomfortable, tell me! It's why I prefer to get triggers laid out and known FIRST.</li>
        <li>My triggers in RP are guilt-tripping and graphic depictions of self-harm.</li>
    </ol>
