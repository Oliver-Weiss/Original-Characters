            <p><i>Agramon works at a semi-popular butler cafe. The staff is exclusively made up of demons. This is also where Agramon's own popularity comes from. Sometimes, he's made to crossdress for the job. He happens to bump into quite the sadistic angel one day, unknowingly capturing the man's attention whilst wearing a maid dress his boss put him in. This, mixed in with the demon's cuteness, is enough to draw him in and get him to stalk the demon, wanting to take him for himself.</i></p>
